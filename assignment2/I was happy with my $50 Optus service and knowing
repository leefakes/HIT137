I was happy with my $50 Optus service and knowing I was about to enter a high usage period went to my local store to setup a second service with shared data so that I could avoid any billing issues. This was an $80 for 80GB service and although more than I needed ,130GB in total, gave me peace of mind that I was looking for. Apparently the sharing linking in the systems backend did not work correctly and I started to receive excess data notifications. I contacted Optus and was assured not to worry as the account had been noted and I would not be charged the excess. My August bill came in and instead of $130 it was $390. I contacted Optus again. I was told that there was nothing to worry about and that the credit would be applied before the payment was due. The full amount of $390 was taken from my account. I contacted Optus and was told the credit hadn't been applied in time. I was told I would get a refund by cheque and received an email on 18 Sep saying the cheque had been approved and sent. The cheque has still not arrived. I was told not to worry that it was all fixed. I received a notification of excess data charges for the next month. I contact Optus. I am told it is noted , etc. I removed the direct debit and cancelled the second service. The bill came in for $380. I paid my $50 via BPay and called Optus about the problem and they agreed to credit the rest. They only  credited $280. I am owed $260 from Aug and a $50 credit is needed for Sep. The bill is due Monday.
